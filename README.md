# Progression
Progression is an android application made by me to help me track my workouts.
In the application I can easily record my repetitions and the used weights of my usual exercises at my last few workouts.
There is an option to view an exercise with a line graph (using GraphView and previously recorded data) so the progress is easy to track.
